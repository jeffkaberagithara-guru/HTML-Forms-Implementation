## Structured HTML forms demonstrating Semantic HTML practices
- This is a semantic,accessible and structured HTML registration form.
- It collects personal,contact,preference and account information from users in a way that is easy to understand,user friendly and standards compliant.
- It uses semantic elements like < form >,< fieldset >,< legend >,< label > and input types like (email,date,week,color) to ensure both humans and browsers can interpret the form correctly.

## Purpose of the Form
- Is to allow a user to register for a service,membership or application by submitting their information and ensuring all necessary are collected in logical sections.

## Purpose of each section:-
- #### Personal information
     Collects basic details.
- #### Contact & Address Information
     Captures communication details like email,phone,website and location.
- #### Preference & Interests
     Asks users about preferences (favourite color,experience level,interests and education background). This helps personalize their experiences.
- #### Account Security
     Ensures the user sets up a secure password for their account.
- #### Feedback & Additional Information
     Provides a space for open-ended input,allowing users to share extra details about themselves.

 ## File Structure Explanation:-
 - #### index.html
      Contains the semantic html code.
 - #### styles.css
      Optional styling file.

 ## Implementation Notes (Approach)
 - #### Semantic HTML
      Use < fieldsets > and < legends > to logically group fields.
 - #### Accessibility
      All inputs are linked with < label for="id" >, ensuring screen readers can interpret them.

      Use email,date,url,color,range,month,week and time to take advantage of HTML5 validations and UI controls.
