- # User Registration Form (Semantic HTML)

   This is a semantic, accessible and structured HTML5 registration form.

   It collects personal, contact, preference, and account information from users in a way that is easy to understand, user-friendly and standards-compliant.

   It uses semantic elements like < form >, < fieldset >, < legend >, < label >, and input types (email, date, week, color, etc.) to ensure both humans and browsers or (screen readers) can interpret the form correctly.


- # Purpose of the Form

   The purpose of this form is to allow a user to register for a service, membership, or application by submitting their information.

   It ensures that all necessary details are collected in logical sections:

   Personal Information → Basic identity details

   Contact & Address → Communication details

   Preferences & Interests → User’s choices and personality traits

   Account Security → Password setup

   Feedback & Additional Information → Open-ended responses


- ## Purpose of Each Section

   Collects basic details like name, date of birth, gender and profile photo.

- #### Contact & Address Information

   Captures communication details like email, phone, website and location (city, country, postal code).

- #### Preferences & Interests

   Asks users about preferences (favorite color, experience level, availability, interests and education background).

   This can help personalize their experience.
